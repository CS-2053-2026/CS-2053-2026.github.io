# Software Setup and Requirements for CS 2053

## TL;DR

- We will be using Godot 4.4.1
- We will use GitHub for as much as possible in the class, which we recommend using the commandline git utility to work with


## Installing Godot 4.4.1

This course requires you to use Godot in your course work to create games. We will use Godot 4.4.1, which you can install on your personal computers or use in the CS labs.

- [Download Godot 4.4.1 here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4-stable/)

## Create a GitHub Account

We will use GitHub extensively in this class to access code and submit assignments. This takes a little bit of learning to begin with, but it is well worth the little bit of effort. You will use the same account for everything in this class, so you might consider making a new account.

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) (if you don't already have one)
